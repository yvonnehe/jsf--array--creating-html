// Convert API data to HTML (API: https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/)
// The API returns a list of Rick and Morty characters.

// 1. View the API in your browser to see the data you will recieve.
//    The API returns and object with a property called results.  Results is an array of characters.
// 2. Look at the properties/data on each character.
// 3. Create a function called renderCharacter that will take in one of the character objects.
//    The function will return an HTML string that contains the characters: id, name, species and image.
//    The function will be used when mapping through the API response.
//    You can test the function works by copying one of the API results into a variable and calling the function with it.
// 4. Use fetch to connect to the API and get the JSON.
// 5. On the JSON response, use array.map on the 'results' arrays.
//    Use the renderCharacter function for mapping the data to HTML.
// 6. Output the mapped HTML in the browser.
// 
// 7. BONUS TASK - use array.filter to only show characters that are alive.
